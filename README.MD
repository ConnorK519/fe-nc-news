This project was a portfolio piece from my time on the NorthCoders bootcamp where each of us had to write our own back end and front end. Here is some general info on how to navigate my app, clicking the main header on the page takes you back to the home page while clicking the title of any article will take you to that articles page where you will find It's comments section with a like and dislike button.

as for the nav bar the users button takes you to a page to select a user to set yourself as for testing and setting the user context for posting comments and other functionality
